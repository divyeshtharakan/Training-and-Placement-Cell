Training and Placement Cell is an offline desktop application wherein the students and the faculty can experience various facilities provided by the system in their own dashboard. It is a secured system with a proper login/register portal to ensure the concerned authority is only using it. The database stores all information from personal to education. 
This system can be used as an application under the Training and Placement Department to manage student details and their biodata for future job perspectives. The benefit here is that students don’t need to research in thousands of websites for opportunities as the faculty will provide everything possible through this single application. 
The students can edit and update their profile whenever required to ease the process of selection. The admin/faculty will be able to have a thorough look into the profile of all students and henceforth take a decision as to accept it or not. 
As security has to be taken into consideration, a 4 digit code is sent to the mail id and only if the code is verified, the account is accessible.
